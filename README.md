# Classification-of-Celestial-Bodies-TeamSix

The study of celestial objects including planets, stars, galaxies, comets and asteroids is a fascinating and vast area of astronomy. Though high-resolution photos of these objects have been captured by astronomers using telescopes and sophisticated imaging methods, it can take a lot of time and effort to manually analyze these photographs and classify the various celestial bodies. The aim of this project is to create a deep learning model that can precisely categorize various kinds of celestial objects based on the images that are sourced from various entities. A pre-trained CNN model will be fine-tuned using our dataset which includes astronomical photos of planets and moons. The successful completion of this project will enable end users to quickly and accurately classify celestial bodies, which will help them in their research and study of the universe.
